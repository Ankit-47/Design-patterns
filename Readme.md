# Design Patterns in Python

This repository demonstrates the implementation of four essential design patterns in Python: **Singleton**, **Factory**, **Strategy**, and **Observer**. These patterns are commonly used in software development to solve recurring design problems. In this repository, you'll find easy-to-understand explanations for each pattern.

## Singleton Pattern

### What is the Singleton Pattern?

The Singleton Pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. This is useful when you want to control access to shared resources or maintain state consistency across the application.

- The `__new__` method is typically used to control the creation of the instance, ensuring that only one instance is ever created.
- Any subsequent attempts to create an instance of the class will return the existing instance.

## Factory Pattern

### What is the Factory Pattern?

The Factory Pattern is a creational pattern that provides a way to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created. Instead of calling a constructor directly, a factory method is used.

- The factory class is responsible for creating objects, and the client code interacts with the factory rather than creating instances directly.
- This pattern helps in creating objects that are part of a larger family or hierarchy of classes.

## Strategy Pattern

### What is the Strategy Pattern?

The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows a method to be selected at runtime. It enables an algorithm to be defined as a family of methods, which can be switched dynamically.

- The pattern defines a family of algorithms (or strategies), encapsulates them, and allows the client to choose the strategy to use at runtime.
- This provides flexibility and enables the client to choose the behavior without modifying the object that uses it.

## Observer Pattern

### What is the Observer Pattern?

The Observer Pattern is a behavioral design pattern where an object (the subject) maintains a list of dependents (observers) that need to be notified of any state changes.

- The subject maintains a list of observers and notifies them whenever its state changes.
- This pattern is useful for scenarios where multiple objects need to be updated when an event occurs in another object.

## Conclusion

This repository provides simple and clear explanations of these four design patterns. Understanding and using design patterns can help you write more flexible, maintainable, and scalable code.

Feel free to explore the concepts and apply them in your own projects!
